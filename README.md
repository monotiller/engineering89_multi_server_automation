# Multi Machine automated deployment
Similar to before but this time we're using [Docker](https://github.com/monotiller/engineering89_docker) to setup our virtual machines. Simply clone this repository, switch to the 'docker' branch, and then run in the root of the folder:
```console
docker-compose up -d --build  
```
And you'll be ready to go!
